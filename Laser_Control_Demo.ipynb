    "Here is a demo for operating the NKT Photonics SuperK COMPACT laser with SELECT tunable filter. To get started, make sure the laser is physically turned on, the interlock key is switched to the \"ON\" position, and the knob on the SELECT is turned to \"OPEN\". The laser can also be used with the Control software, but make sure this is disconnected when running the demo. There are three device classes we will be using: \n",
